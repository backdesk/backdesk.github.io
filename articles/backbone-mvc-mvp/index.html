Are Backbone's Views Controllers?

What are the high level responsibilities of each?

    Controllers

    "Controller can be imagined as an extension or a personal assistant to the view, all the events
    originated from the view are handled by the controller. Controller will also inform the Model on
    behalf of view that some event happened on the view and some new data might be required."

    http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/288928/Differences-between-MVC-and-MVP-for-Beginners


    "In the MVC, the Controller is responsible for determining which View is displayed in response to any
    action including when the application loads. This differs from MVP where actions route through the View
    to the Presenter. In MVC, every action in the View correlates with a call to a Controller along with an
    action. In the web each action involves a call to a URL on the other side of which there is a Controller
    who responds. Once that Controller has completed its processing, it will return the correct View.
    The sequence continues in that manner throughout the life of the application"

    "One other big difference about MVC is that the View does not directly bind to the Model. The view simply
    renders, and is completely stateless. In implementations of MVC the View usually will not have any
    logic in the code behind. This is contrary to MVP where it is absolutely necessary as if the View does
    not delegate to the Presenter, it will never get called."

    "In MVC, the view is updated only by the model (by listening to its events). It is never updated by the controller.
    This is problematic when you need to format model data for the view, hence the need for MVP." - wrong?

    Presenters

    In MVP the Presenter assumes the functionality of the "middle-man" (played by the Application Controller in MVC).
    Additionally, the View is responsible for handling the UI events (like mouseDown, keyDown, etc), which used
    to be the Controller's job. Eventually, the Model becomes strictly a Domain Model.

    A presenter can be defined as a logical entity that makes decisions on behalf of a view. The intention behind it
    is to provide improve the testability so the view should be dumbed down and delegate to its presenter.

"Although originally developed for desktop computing, model–view–controller has been widely adopted as an architecture
for World Wide Web applications in major programming languages. Several commercial and noncommercial web application
frameworks have been created that enforce the pattern. These frameworks vary in their interpretations, mainly in the
way that the MVC responsibilities are divided between the client and server."

<h3 id="are-backbone-s-views-controllers-">Are Backbone’s Views …&nbsp;Controllers?</h3>
<p>It’s tricky to find a ‘one size fits all’ definition of a controller and its responsibilities. Responsibilities
are open to interpretation based on the platform [1] and framework you’re using. I think that the underlying
principle rests at separating concerns. How a code base achieves this separation is what ultimately
defines the role of a&nbsp;controller.</p>
<p>In a bare bone Backbone application ‘Backbone.View’ could be considered a controller as its logic drives a
‘dumb view’ aspect using templates. Model events and user interactions are handled within the view logic
and reflected in the rendered&nbsp;template.</p>
<!--

This approach will get you quite far and bring structure and order beyond using standard page objects.

A primary gain from MVC should be that business logic can be presented in different ways and tested in
isolation by itself [3]. When complexity increases the application could be scaled with the introduction of
additonal controllers [4].

Sub views
    Views that conditionally render content within their own container.

Layouts
    Hook on to 'regions' of a template and assign views to regions.

Controllers without internal view logic.
    In other words logic that renders a conditionally renders a view based on state.
    Not unlike a router.
