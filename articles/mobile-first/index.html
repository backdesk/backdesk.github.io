            <h2>Mobile First, Does it Work?</h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I’ve often wondered if a ‘Mobile First’ approach is more of an ideal than a concrete&nbsp;strategy.</p>
<hr>
<p>As we know mobile is (most likely) the forseeable future of the web and the pace of this revolution is rapidly driving an urgency for companies to have a strategy in place. A popular trend in strategy leans towards the concept of ‘Mobile&nbsp;First’.</p>
<p>The intention of this post is to share some of the conclusions I arrived at when studying the many definitons of ‘Mobile&nbsp;First’.</p>
<h3 id="prototypes-vs-flat-designs">Prototypes vs. Flat&nbsp;Designs</h3>
<p>We had relatively few problems to solve when I first became a web developer. Designs were handed to me in the form of a Photoshop file which I did my utmost to make pixel perfect using <span class="caps">HTML</span>/CSS. There wasn’t a real requirement for responsive&nbsp;behavior.</p>
<p>These days I engage a lot more with designers and at an earlier stage as well. In the past it might of been that design was a production phase where upon its completion you would receive assets to work with. That doesn’t quite cut the mustard any&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>I’ve learned that it’s important to get involved with the concept at an early stage and from there start working towards building a&nbsp;prototype.</p>
<p>I guess you could argue that the mobile aspect of the design is the simplest and for that reason - this is where we should&nbsp;start.</p>
<h3 id="context-branching-vs-context-adaptation">Context Branching vs. Context&nbsp;Adaptation</h3>
<p>I tend to think of audiences as contexts under which an application&nbsp;runs.</p>
<p>In my opinion a good example of this failure is Windows 8. But that’s probably a topic best left for another&nbsp;post!</p>
<h3 id="copy">Copy</h3>
<p>How you write and revise copy should also be a consideration in an adaptive solution. A moderately large block of copy might look great on the higher resolutions but lengthly and overkill on&nbsp;mobile.</p>
