            <h2>A Guide to Contracting</h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>A basic guide to weighing up the options and how to get up and&nbsp;running.</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s great that you’re considering contracting and I know it can be hard to find the information you need to make an informed&nbsp;decision.</p>
<h3 id="the-benefits">The&nbsp;Benefits</h3>
<p>The biggest appeal for me was the idea that I would gain more exposure to different technologies and approaches in a relatively short amount of time. I also tend to think of contracting as the only real way of staying ahead of new&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>The more obvious benefits&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Larger&nbsp;income</li>
<li>Flexible working hours and&nbsp;holiday</li>
<li>Able to work for multiple&nbsp;clients</li>
</ul>
<p>Annual and sick leave are benefits you might take for granted in a permanent&nbsp;position.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You are entitled to a minimum of 5.6 weeks paid annual leave (28 days for someone working five days a week)”
— <a href="http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/holiday-entitlements">NIDirect</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paid leave is definitely a perk worth examining. You’re entitled to an allocation of 28 days from which public holidays can be deducted so in effect around 20 days. In comparison a contractor could take as much unpaid leave as they want by carefully planning assignments and subsidising leave with a larger net&nbsp;income.</p>
<p>Companies aren’t obliged to make a contractual provision for sick pay and if you’re working for a company that doesn’t run it’s own sick pay scheme then you’re stuck with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay/overview">Statutory Sick Pay</a> (<span class="caps">SSP</span>) which pays a meager £87.55 a week. That’s £17.50 a day! As a contractor you wouldn’t get paid at all but £17 is hardly a deal&nbsp;breaker.</p>
<h3 id="umbrella-or-limited">Umbrella or&nbsp;Limited</h3>
<p>I started out with an umbrella to keep cash coming in while I carefully investigated the option of running a limited company. There are a lot of ‘formation’ companies out there but I chose to register my company through companies house. Why? Because it’s cheaper and simpler in my opinion. Some accountant firms also offer startup packages which include formation. I think that’s a good time saver but if you’re new to this I would encourage you to do your homework&nbsp;first.</p>
<p>You should be able to claw in more from your contracts through a limited&nbsp;company.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flat rate <span class="caps">VAT</span>&nbsp;surplus</li>
<li>Expenses</li>
<li>Dividends</li>
<li>Basic&nbsp;Salary</li>
<li>Directors&nbsp;loans</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these subjects are covered in detail on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/"><span class="caps">GOV</span>.UK</a></p>
<p>How much you get from your umbrella depends on your circumstances but they should be able to give you a projection based on your most recent P45. Providing that the umbrella doesn’t stipulate fees for you leaving and nonsense like that you can use it for as long as you need. I personally recommend <a href="http://www.access-a.co.uk/," title="Accessa Umbrella">Accessa</a> as they don’t have any hidden&nbsp;fees.</p>
<h3 id="accounting">Accounting</h3>
<p>I had some frustrations with accountancy firms that wanted to do everything for me without properly communicating what it is they’re actually doing. I think they often confuse the burden of having to manage everything with having to think about everything. Accountants don’t really understand the personal aspects of a startup and how reliant you are on them to tell you everything is in order. Running a new business can be scary, especially if you’re new to everything. It’s often quoted that most businesses that fail within their infancy do so due to poor financial management. With that in mind you’re putting a lot of trust in whoever you choose to manage your&nbsp;books.</p>
<p>What I needed was a top level view of my business that I could discuss and interact over with an&nbsp;accountant.</p>
<p>I highly recommend <a href="http://www.freeagent.co.uk/">FreeAgent</a></p>
<h3 id="taxes">Taxes</h3>
<p>Tax law not only confuses me but also terrifies me. It seems that you’re guilty until proven innocent should you fall under <span class="caps">HMRC</span>’s&nbsp;spotlight.</p>
