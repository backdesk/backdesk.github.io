<h2 id="the-right-choice">The Right&nbsp;Choice</h2>
<p>It’s great that you’re considering becoming a contractor and I know that it’s hard to find the information you need to convince you to take the plunge or&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>This post isn’t intended to sway you in either direction but rather reflect on some of my experiences since starting out and share with you the conclusions I came&nbsp;to.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-chose-contracting">Why I Chose&nbsp;Contracting</h2>
<p>The biggest appeal for me was the idea that I would gain more exposure to different technologies and approaches in a relatively short amount of time. I tend to think of contracting as the only tangiable way of staying ahead of new&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>The more obvious benefits&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Larger&nbsp;income</li>
<li>Flexible working hours and&nbsp;holiday</li>
<li>Able to work for multiple&nbsp;clients</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="umbrella-or-limited">Umbrella or&nbsp;Limited</h2>
<p>I say both. Initially I chose an umbrella to hold the fort while I carefully investigated the option of a limited company. Providing that the umbrella doesn’t stipulate fees for you leaving them and nonsense like that you can use it for as long as you&nbsp;need.</p>
<h2 id="find-an-accountant-that-works-for-you">Find an Accountant That Works for&nbsp;You</h2>
<p>I highly recommend FreeAgent and finding an accountant who will work with you using&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="ir35"><span class="caps">IR35</span></h2>
<p>Tax law not only confuses me but also terrifies me. It seems that you’re guilty until proven innocent should you fall under <span class="caps">HMRC</span>’s&nbsp;spotlight.</p>
