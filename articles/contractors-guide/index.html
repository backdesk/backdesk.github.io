          <section class="content"><p>A basic guide to weighing up the options and getting up and&nbsp;running.</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s great that you’re considering becoming a contractor and I know that it’s hard to find the information you need to convince you to take the plunge or&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>This post isn’t intended to sway you in either direction but rather reflect on some of my experiences since starting&nbsp;out.</p>
<h3 id="why-i-chose-contracting">Why I Chose&nbsp;Contracting</h3>
<p>The biggest appeal for me was the idea that I would gain more exposure to different technologies and approaches in a relatively short amount of time. I tend to think of contracting as the only real way of staying ahead of new&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>The more obvious benefits&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Larger&nbsp;income</li>
<li>Flexible working hours and&nbsp;holiday</li>
<li>Able to work for multiple&nbsp;clients</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Companies aren’t obliged to make a contractual provision for sick pay and if you’re working for a company that doesn’t run it’s own sick pay scheme you’re stuck with ‘Statutory Sick Pay (<span class="caps">SSP</span>)’ which pays £87.55 a&nbsp;week.</p>
<h3 id="umbrella-or-limited">Umbrella or&nbsp;Limited</h3>
<p>I chose both. Initially I went with an umbrella to hold the fort while I carefully investigated the option of a limited company. Providing that the umbrella doesn’t stipulate fees for you leaving and nonsense like that you can use it for as long as you need. I would personally recommend <a href="http://www.access-a.co.uk/," title="Accessa Umbrella">Accessa</a>.</p>
<h3 id="find-an-accountant-that-works-for-you">Find an Accountant That Works for&nbsp;You</h3>
<p>I highly recommend FreeAgent and finding an accountant who will work with you using&nbsp;it.</p>
<h3 id="ir35"><span class="caps">IR35</span></h3>
<p>Tax law not only confuses me but also terrifies me. It seems that you’re guilty until proven innocent should you fall under <span class="caps">HMRC</span>’s&nbsp;spotlight.</p>
